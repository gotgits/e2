  + Create user input to interact with the images and clues/facts.

##  Notes for instructor

 After exhaustive attempts to refine my Project 1 game to accumulate sums in progressive order to emulate taking turns on a board going forward with a dice roll (which seemed like such an ordinary task), without sufficient results, I realized that understanding the purpose of Project 2 Form Processing with user input was still not being addressed. Therefore, I analyzed your inspiring *Word Scramble* game and decided working within this structure would be a better use of the time left. This offered many unique troubleshooting challenges of its own! One of which is that I can still only get a consistent accurate correct answer result in the Firefox browser. The other was the naming of the images to avoid interfering with the random logic matching images with the array key value items.
