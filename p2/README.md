##  Notes for instructor

 After exhaustive attempts to refine my Project 1 game to accumulate sums in progressive order to emulate taking turns on a board going forward with a dice roll (which seemed like such an ordinary task), without sufficient results, I realized that understanding the purpose of Project 2 Form Processing with user input was still not being addressed. Therefore, I analyzed your inspiring *Word Scramble* game and decided working within this structure would be a better use of the time left.
