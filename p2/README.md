##  Notes for instructor

  

After exhaustive attempts to refine my Project 1 game to accumulate sums in progressive order to emulate taking turns on a board going forward with a dice roll (which seemed like such an ordinary task), without sufficient results, I realized that understanding the purpose of Project 2 Form Processing with user input was still not being addressed. Therefore, I studied your inspiring *Word Scramble* game and decided working within this structure would be a better use of the time left. This offered many unique troubleshooting challenges of its own. One of which is that I can still only get a consistent accurate correct answer result in the Firefox browser. I experiemented with adding selected to my select menu, that made Safari work, but broke Firefox, and Chrome remained inaccurate.
