- Side note, I have played less than 25 times on any computer game or video console game of any kind in my very long lifetime. I have zero experience even thinking about them. My daughter will absolutely laugh at anything I make I'm sure. But I do love playing cards and I am a visual artist, so I feel like I can wrap my head around it some. CSCIs3 and DGMDe12 have given me a meditative foundation as well.
