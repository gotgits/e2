## Game planning
_Begin at 0 and Finish by crossing 25 or (25+1) Steps:_
+ _Create an array of integers from from 0-25.
+ _Alternate Turns are taken by Player1 and Player2 with random values created by conditional statements created from the array 0-25.
+ _Players begin at 0 on the array, which has a value of 0.
+ _First if statement, will separate an array of odd numbers only. [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25].
+ _From the odd number array the unique conditions will extend
+ _Random numbers from 1-25 will be generated by each player alternately. If no additional conditions player just moves forward random number steps.
+ _Only forward or cumulative positive movement as a rule. Exceptions will be the positions that force  backward or negative movement and that resets the player position to condition and their forward movement total begins from there.
+ _**Do I assign unique variables to each of the unique position conditional statements?**
+ _Whichever player reaches 25++ first wins. Game resets.
+ _A more complex score could be, winner gains 100 points and play x amount of rounds for high score. Or play best out of three.
+ _Run program until winner, document moves.
+ _Report the results of Player A's Move, Player B's move, the flip, and the winner to the page_
