## Notes for instructor
- Question about file paths with the subdomain, so far no arrangement of links with and without subdomain, with and with out public_html, also varied with /var/www/ and with and without /e2/p1/ or /e2p1/ have resulted in just seeing the image in the browser. I realize that php is not client side, but ordinarily I can see an image that is on the server.
I have also worked in terminal using ls -la and setting permissions, only to remove all permissions for my test image that I have included with index-view.php. So I replaced them and they reverted. 
Please clarify what path might work.
